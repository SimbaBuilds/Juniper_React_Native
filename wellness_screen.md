I am giving you context of the web page, React version of a wellness screen. (wellness_web_reference.md)
I want to implement just the trends chart and summary functionalities from the web version in a Wellness Screen in this React Native project.

Specs:
- Summary at the top of the page with configurable metric display
- Trends chart with same metric display interface and the option to add a trends chart
- Display settings saved in local storage

Please create an implementation plan.
