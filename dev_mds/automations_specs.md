- Voice to Voice Automations for MVP would be dope e.g. forward emails like the one I just got from X to Y
- Cron jobs if no service webhook
- It will have to write and execute and iterate on a test script for the automation it builds
- Fetch service tools and scripts on its own or delegate to IA? Probably have its own fetching capability for less coordination cost
- EDA creation in web app - chat functionality in web app - *short max chat message length -* no user message caching - “message exceeds max length.  shorten message or write in text document in integrated service”
- Hot Phrases
    - “Cut processing time by more than 50% for the tasks below”
    - Functionality: bypass Chat Agent and service/type level fetching and call IA with pre-injected tool params and associated resources (reuse DS function)
        - “When you are called directly by the human user, keep your response brief e.g. “Done!”
        - if calling agent = None, “You are currently being called directly by the human user”
