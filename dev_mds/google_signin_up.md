We are implementing Google Sign-In/Up with Supabase

1. Please first analyze the current Supabase auth implementation and context
2. Then, analyze the working gmail integration auth as an example of working google auth with HTTPS redirect
3. View up to date Google Auth with Supabase Auth docs 
4. Add Sign In with Google option to the Login Page and Sign Up with Google to the Sign Up Page
5. Implement Google Auth with Supabase Auth functionality and link it to components, using "google" as the service name in the redirect URL template and https://ydbabipbxxleeiiysojv.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback as the Supabase callback (if needed)
