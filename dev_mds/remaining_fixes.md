- [ ]  resume WWD no longer auto triggering a false WWD state after retries exhausted, but not actually working and detecting wake word when I say it
- [ ]  still 3 retries even though I've changed 3 --> 1 in every place I can find.  I only want one retry on no speech detected, then wake word detection should resume
- [ ]  Volume is muted on initial system sounds and first TTS, then volume increases/goes back to normal
