I refactored and reimagined the memories feature of this app and it will now be a Repo of Resources.  It will hold memories but also,“samples”, “notes”, “files”, “media”,and “other” 

- Change the “Memories” screen to “Repo”
- I want resources from the db table to be displayed in this new Repo screen; categories should be “memories”, “samples”, “notes”, “files”, “media”, “other” - show 5 most recently accessed for each type using “last_accessed” field with a "show more" button that loads all from past 30 days of that type
- Resources can be added to or changed in the new UI just like in the old memories UI
- Please create a plan for updating the implementation in this front end project accordingly.
