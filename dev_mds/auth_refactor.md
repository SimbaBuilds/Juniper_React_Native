I have deleted the OauthCallbackhandler file and logic because that is a deprected feature.  Keep the completeIntegration calls.


Please modify all integration callbacks to mimick the working google auth https redirect as I have already configured all redirect URLs in dev consoles to redirect to 'https://hightower-ai.com/oauth/<service_name>/callback'
