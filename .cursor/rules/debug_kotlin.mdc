Description: Use these rules when we are debugging a feature

- Find 3 possible causes, and dont implement changes yet.
- Add logs, clear logcat, and start logcat again in the terminal that you are currently in so that logs are automatically included in context 
- After implementing changes run cd android && ./gradlew compileDebugKotlin in the current terminal so that logs are automatically added to context
- Do not create a summary markdown or README unless asked
