A few questions.  Please respond briefly to each.

- [ ]  any more permission.health permissions we can add in addition to what you've implemented?
- [ ]  There are already native voice permissions flows for Android in this app - was it necessary to create a new file for this or can we use existing voice permissions patterns?  How do your most recent changes to AndroidManifest, app.json, and your added PermissionsRationaleActivity integrate with existing permissions handling?
- [ ] any env vars or project creds need to be obtained and set?
- [ ] need to update apple provisioning profile or create new to support apple health kit?
