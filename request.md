Great, one more thing.  Currently, we only have metrics sync for Apple and Google Health on app launch, but the integration completion flow requires synced metrics.  Please add a sync on callback from the permissions/auth flow for both Google Health Connect and Apple Health so that metrics will be avilable for integration completion.
