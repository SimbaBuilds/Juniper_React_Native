Under the Health and Wellness section in the integrations screen please add a note: 

"Medical Records" (this is not in the services tables)

            Provide medical records to Juniper so it can provide valuable insights and conversation around your health data - we do not share your records with third parties.


              Upload and manage your medical records in your <Link href="/repository"><u>Repository</u></Link> in the web app.


Please have medical records show up like a service and show the note and link above on expansion like the database services.
