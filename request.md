We successfully created user connection records with issuers.  Now we need to tackle rendering and connect logic for selected providers.  As you can see - my rendering and mapping is a bit complciated and exists in both the .tsx and .ts Integrations files, but we can't and shouldn't include map names for all 700+ providers.  Please come up with a few ideas and provide a recommendation
